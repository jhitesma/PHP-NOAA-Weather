Gets current and forecast weather data from weather.gov.  Using weather.gov recommendations, 
a method is also provided which groups weather conditions and maps each group to a graphical weather icon.

Dependencies

xmlize - https://github.com/rmccue/XMLize
Used for de-serializing weather xml feeds

Usage
----------------------------

See example.php

CURRENT CONDITIONS

I've only added summary, temp and the icon for current conditions.  
Feel free to map the other line items from feed (e.g. wind speed, rel humidity etc)

current_summary
current_temp
current_icon_default
current_icon_custom

the default icon is the one provided by NOAA.  I have added a method to map weather summaries to custom icons.  
Calling current_icon_custom will grab the custom icon and override the default icon.

FORECAST

The forecast feed provided by NOAA is split up into night and day periods, 
with low temps being grouped in the night periods and high temps in the day period.  
Additionally, detailed conditions are provided in a 3rd period which lists both 
days and nights.

get_weather will create an associative array of time periods and the weather values.  It will copy both low and high temps into each day period for simplicity.
E.g.  It will take the "Low" temp for "Wednesday Night" and copy it to "Wednesday"
